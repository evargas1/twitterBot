# twitterBot

Baic code layout for the twitter bot that uses the Tweepy API. The bot will run every 30min and checks if certain users have tweeted
and if they include an @ to our specific account, if so we will retweet on our account. 

This ensures that our social media account stays updated as it is the main district account. 

The bot was deployed using docker and is hosted on AWS.
